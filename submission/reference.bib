	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Colorectal polyp cancers present clinicians with a treatment dilemma. Decisions regarding whether to offer segmental resection or endoscopic surveillance are often taken without reference to good quality evidence. The aim of this study was to develop a treatment algorithm for patients with screen-detected polyp cancers.
DESIGN: This national cohort study included all patients with a polyp cancer identified through the Scottish Bowel Screening Programme between 2000 and 2012. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess the impact of clinical, endoscopic and pathological variables on the rate of adverse events (residual tumour in patients undergoing segmental resection or cancer-related death or disease recurrence in any patient). These data were used to develop a clinically relevant treatment algorithm.
RESULTS: 485 patients with polyp cancers were included. 186/485 (38\%) underwent segmental resection and residual tumour was identified in 41/186 (22\%). The only factor associated with an increased risk of residual tumour in the bowel wall was incomplete excision of the original polyp (OR 5.61, p=0.001), while only lymphovascular invasion was associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastases (OR 5.95, p=0.002). When patients undergoing segmental resection or endoscopic surveillance were considered together, the risk of adverse events was significantly higher in patients with incomplete excision (OR 10.23, p{\textless}0.001) or lymphovascular invasion (OR 2.65, p=0.023).
CONCLUSION: A policy of surveillance is adequate for the majority of patients with screen-detected colorectal polyp cancers. Consideration of segmental resection should be reserved for those with incomplete excision or evidence of lymphovascular invasion.},

	doi = {10.3748/wjg.v19.i45.8366},
	abstract = {AIM: To determine the role of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), used to evaluate fecal hemoglobin concentration, in the prediction of histological grade and risk of colorectal tumors.
METHODS: We enrolled 17881 individuals who attended the two-step colorectal cancer screening program in a single hospital between January 2010 and October 2011. Colonoscopy was recommended to the participants with an FIT of ≥ 12 ngHb/mL buffer. We classified colorectal lesions as cancer (C), advanced adenoma (AA), adenoma (A), and others (O) by their colonoscopic and histological findings. Multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for age and gender was used to determine the association between the FIT results and colorectal tumor grade. The risk of adenomatous neoplasia was estimated by calculating the positive predictive values for different FIT concentrations.
RESULTS: The positive rate of the FIT was 10.9\% (1948/17881). The attendance rate for colonoscopy was 63.1\% (1229/1948). The number of false positive results was 23. Of these 1229 cases, the numbers of O, A, AA, and C were 759, 221, 201, and 48, respectively. Regression analysis revealed a positive association between histological grade and FIT concentration (β = 0.088, P {\textless} 0.01). A significant log-linear relationship was found between the concentration and positive predictive value of the FIT for predicting colorectal tumors (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.95, P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Higher FIT concentrations are associated with more advanced histological grades. Risk prediction for colorectal neoplasia based on individual FIT concentrations is significant and may help to improve the performance of screening programs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic and preclinical data suggest that higher intake and serum levels of vitamin D and higher intake of calcium reduce the risk of colorectal neoplasia. To further study the chemopreventive potential of these nutrients, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both for the prevention of colorectal adenomas.
METHODS: We recruited patients with recently diagnosed adenomas and no known colorectal polyps remaining after complete colonoscopy. We randomly assigned 2259 participants to receive daily vitamin D3 (1000 IU), calcium as carbonate (1200 mg), both, or neither in a partial 2×2 factorial design. Women could elect to receive calcium plus random assignment to vitamin D or placebo. Follow-up colonoscopy was anticipated to be performed 3 or 5 years after the baseline examinations, according to the endoscopist's recommendation. The primary end point was adenomas diagnosed in the interval from randomization through the anticipated surveillance colonoscopy.
RESULTS: Participants who were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D had a mean net increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 7.83 ng per milliliter, relative to participants given placebo. Overall, 43\% of participants had one or more adenomas diagnosed during follow-up. The adjusted risk ratios for recurrent adenomas were 0.99 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.09) with vitamin D versus no vitamin D, 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.85 to 1.06) with calcium versus no calcium, and 0.93 (95\% CI, 0.80 to 1.08) with both agents versus neither agent. The findings for advanced adenomas were similar. There were few serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily supplementation with vitamin D3 (1000 IU), calcium (1200 mg), or both after removal of colorectal adenomas did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas over a period of 3 to 5 years.

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk with high red meat (HRM) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. In the present study, we examined whether a HRM diet increased rectal O(6)-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (O(6)MeG) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (HAMSB) was protective. A group of twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (HRM diet) or with 40 g/d of HAMSB (HRM+HAMSB diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. Stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. The HRM diet increased rectal O(6)MeG adducts relative to its baseline by 21\% (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas the addition of HAMSB to the HRM diet prevented this increase. Epithelial proliferation increased with both the HRM (P {\textless} 0.001) and HRM + HAMSB (P {\textless} 0.05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the HRM + HAMSB diet compared with the HRM diet (P {\textless} 0.05). Relative to its baseline, the HRM + HAMSB diet increased the excretion of SCFA by over 20\% (P {\textless} 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the Clostridium coccoides group (P {\textless} 0.05), the Clostridium leptum group (P {\textless} 0.05), Lactobacillus spp. (P {\textless} 0.01), Parabacteroides distasonis (P {\textless} 0.001) and Ruminococcus bromii (P {\textless} 0.05), but lowered Ruminococcus torques (P {\textless} 0.05) and the proportions of Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques and Escherichia coli (P {\textless} 0.01). HRM consumption could increase the risk of CRC through increased formation of colorectal epithelial O(6)MeG adducts. HAMSB consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool SCFA levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.},

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data regarding cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,529,560 new cancer cases and 569,490 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2010. Overall cancer incidence rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men (1.3\% per year from 2000 to 2006) and women (0.5\% per year from 1998 to 2006), largely due to decreases in the 3 major cancer sites in men (lung, prostate, and colon and rectum [colorectum]) and 2 major cancer sites in women (breast and colorectum). This decrease occurred in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. Among men, death rates for all races combined decreased by 21.0\% between 1990 and 2006, with decreases in lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer rates accounting for nearly 80\% of the total decrease. Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2006 decreased by 12.3\%, with decreases in breast and colorectal cancer rates accounting for 60\% of the total decrease. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates translates to the avoidance of approximately 767,000 deaths from cancer over the 16-year period. This report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year. Although progress has been made in reducing incidence and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated significant reductions in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality associated with polypectomy. However, little is known about whether polypectomy is effective at reducing colorectal cancer risk in routine clinical practice. The aim of this investigation was to quantify colorectal cancer risk following polypectomy in a large prospective population-based cohort study.
METHODS: Patients with incident colorectal polyps between 2000 and 2005 in Northern Ireland were identified via electronic pathology reports received to the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry. Patients were matched to the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry to detect colorectal cancer and deaths up to December 31, 2010. Colorectal cancer standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated and Cox proportional hazards modeling applied to determine colorectal cancer risk.
RESULTS: During 44,724 person-years of follow-up, 193 colorectal cancer cases were diagnosed among 6,972 adenoma patients, representing an annual progression rate of 0.43\%. Colorectal cancer risk was significantly elevated in patients who had an adenoma removed (SIR, 2.85; 95\% CI, 2.61-3.25) compared with the general population. Male sex, older age, rectal site, and villous architecture were associated with an increased colorectal cancer risk in adenoma patients. Further analysis suggested that not having a full colonoscopy performed at, or following, incident polypectomy contributed to the excess colorectal cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer risk was elevated in individuals following polypectomy for adenoma, outside of screening programs.
IMPACT: This finding emphasizes the need for full colonoscopy and adenoma clearance, and appropriate surveillance, after endoscopic diagnosis of adenoma.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Some individuals are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) despite recent colonoscopy. We examined individuals under colonoscopic surveillance for colonic adenomas to assess possible reasons for diagnosing cancer after a recent colonoscopy with complete removal of any identified polyps.
DESIGN: Primary data were pooled from eight large ({\textgreater}800 patients) North American studies in which participants with adenoma(s) had a baseline colonoscopy (with intent to remove all visualised lesions) and were followed with subsequent colonoscopy. We used an algorithm based on the time from previous colonoscopy and the presence, size and histology of adenomas detected at prior exam to assign interval cancers as likely being new, missed, incompletely resected (while previously an adenoma) or due to failed biopsy detection.
RESULTS: 9167 participants (mean age 62) were included in the analyses, with a median follow-up of 47.2 months. Invasive cancer was diagnosed in 58 patients (0.6\%) during follow-up (1.71 per 1000 person-years follow-up). Most cancers (78\%) were early stage (I or II); however, 9 (16\%) resulted in death from CRC. We classified 30 cancers (52\%) as probable missed lesions, 11 (19\%) as possibly related to incomplete resection of an earlier, non-invasive lesion and 14 (24\%) as probable new lesions. The cancer diagnosis may have been delayed in three cases (5\%) because of failed biopsy detection.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent colonoscopy with intent to remove all neoplasia, CRC will occasionally be diagnosed. These cancers primarily seem to represent lesions that were missed or incompletely removed at the prior colonoscopy and might be avoided by increased emphasis on identifying and completely removing all neoplastic lesions at colonoscopy.},

When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The curve is constructed by varying the cutpoint used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive rates. When two or more empirical curves are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between curves must take into account the correlated nature of the data.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous cancers have been linked to microorganisms. Given that colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths and the colon is continuously exposed to a high diversity of microbes, the relationship between gut mucosal microbiome and colorectal cancer needs to be explored. Metagenomic studies have shown an association between Fusobacterium species and colorectal carcinoma. Here, we have extended these studies with deeper sequencing of a much larger number (n = 130) of colorectal carcinoma and matched normal control tissues. We analyzed these data using co-occurrence networks in order to identify microbe-microbe and host-microbe associations specific to tumors.
RESULTS: We confirmed tumor over-representation of Fusobacterium species and observed significant co-occurrence within individual tumors of Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia and Campylobacter species. This polymicrobial signature was associated with over-expression of numerous host genes, including the gene encoding the pro-inflammatory chemokine Interleukin-8. The tumor-associated bacteria we have identified are all Gram-negative anaerobes, recognized previously as constituents of the oral microbiome, which are capable of causing infection. We isolated a novel strain of Campylobacter showae from a colorectal tumor specimen. This strain is substantially diverged from a previously sequenced oral Campylobacter showae isolate, carries potential virulence genes, and aggregates with a previously isolated tumor strain of Fusobacterium nucleatum.
CONCLUSIONS: A polymicrobial signature of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria is associated with colorectal carcinoma tissue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that diet is one of the most important environmental factors involved in the progression from advanced colorectal adenoma (A-CRA) to colorectal cancer.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible effects of dietary fiber on the fecal microbiota of patients with A-CRA.
DESIGN: Patients with a diagnosis of A-CRA by pathological examination were enrolled in the A-CRA group. Patients with no obvious abnormalities or histopathological changes were enrolled in the healthy control (HC) group. Dietary fiber intake was assessed in all patients. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces were detected by gas chromatography. The fecal microbiota community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16S ribosomal RNA.
RESULTS: Lower dietary fiber patterns and consistently lower SCFA production were observed in the A-CRA group (n = 344). Principal component analysis showed distinct differences in the fecal microbiota communities of the 2 groups. Clostridium, Roseburia, and Eubacterium spp. were significantly less prevalent in the A-CRA group (n = 47) than in the HC group (n = 47), whereas Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. were more prevalent in the A-CRA group (n = 47) (all P {\textless} 0.05). Butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria were more prevalent in a subgroup of HC subjects with a high fiber intake than in those in both the low-fiber HC subgroup and the high-fiber A-CRA subgroup (all P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A high-fiber dietary pattern and subsequent consistent production of SCFAs and healthy gut microbiota are associated with a reduced risk of A-CRA. This trial was registered at www.chictr.org as ChiCTR-TRC-00000123.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a significant demand for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening methods that are noninvasive, inexpensive, and capable of accurately detecting early stage tumors. It has been shown that models based on the gut microbiota can complement the fecal occult blood test and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). However, a barrier to microbiota-based screening is the need to collect and store a patient's stool sample.
RESULTS: Using stool samples collected from 404 patients, we tested whether the residual buffer containing resuspended feces in FIT cartridges could be used in place of intact stool samples. We found that the bacterial DNA isolated from FIT cartridges largely recapitulated the community structure and membership of patients' stool microbiota and that the abundance of bacteria associated with CRC were conserved. We also found that models for detecting CRC that were generated using bacterial abundances from FIT cartridges were equally predictive as models generated using bacterial abundances from stool.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for using residual buffer from FIT cartridges in place of stool for microbiota-based screening for CRC. This may reduce the need to collect and process separate stool samples and may facilitate combining FIT and microbiota-based biomarkers into a single test. Additionally, FIT cartridges could constitute a novel data source for studying the role of the microbiome in cancer and other diseases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection of large colorectal polyps.
DESIGN: Relevant publications were identified in MEDLINE/EMBASE/Cochrane Central Register for the period 1966-2014. Studies in which ≥20 mm colorectal neoplastic lesions were treated with endoscopic resection were included. Rates of postendoscopic resection surgery due to non-curative resection or adverse events, as well as the rates of complete endoscopic removal, invasive cancer, adverse events, recurrence and mortality, were extracted. Study quality was ascertained according to Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Forest plot was produced based on random effect models. I2 statistic was used to describe the variation across studies due to heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: 50 studies including 6442 patients and 6779 large polyps were included in the analyses. Overall, 503 out of 6442 patients (pooled rate: 8\%, 95\% CI 7\% to 10\%, I2=78.6\%) underwent surgery due to non-curative endoscopic resection, and 31/6442 (pooled rate: 1\%, 95\% CI 0.7\% to 1.4\%, I2=0\%) to adverse events. Invasive cancer at histology, non-curative endoscopic resection, synchronous lesions and recurrence accounted for 58\%, 28\%, 2.2\% and 5.9\% of all the surgeries, respectively. Endoscopic perforation occurred in 96/6595 (1.5\%, 95\% CI 1.2\% to 1.7\%) polyps, while bleeding in 423/6474 (6.5\%, 95\% CI 5.9\% to 7.1\%). Overall, 5334 patients entered in surveillance, 502/5836 (8.6\%, 95\% CI 7.9\% to 9.3\%) being lost at follow-up. Endoscopic recurrence was detected in 735/5334 patients (13.8\%, 95\% CI 12.9\% to 14.7\%), being an invasive cancer in 14/5334 (0.3\%, 95\% CI 0.1\% to 0.4\%). Endoscopic treatment was successful in 664/735 cases (90.3\%, 95\% CI 88.2\% to 92.5\%). Mortality related with management of large polyps was reported in 5/6278 cases (0.08\%, 95\% CI 0.01\% to 0.15\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic resection of large polyps appeared to be an extremely effective and safe intervention. However, an adequate endoscopic surveillance is necessary for its long-term efficacy.},

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to summarize the accuracy of results of individual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) products across pathology proficiency testing programs.
METHODS: Secondary data analysis of proficiency testing programs' FIT results.
RESULTS: Four of 7 proficiency testing program's FIT evaluations were obtained for a 2-year period. Fourteen unique FIT brands were evaluated by at least 1 of the 4 proficiency testing programs. Five of the products performed similarly with sensitivities ranging from 98.1\% to 98.8\% and specificities from 98.1\% to 99.6\%. Ninety-three percent of the FIT tests completed were manual Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-waived FITs.
CONCLUSIONS: About two thirds of the commonly used FIT products performed acceptably on spiked samples of human hemoglobin. However, some had low sensitivity and specificity and probably should not be used for population-based or other screening.

The Malmö Diet and Cancer Study is a population-based cohort study, including individuals aged 45-74 years. Dietary data were collected through a modified diet history method. The TNM classification was obtained from pathology/clinical records and re-evaluated. Among 27 931 individuals (60\% women), we found 728 incident CRC cases during 428 924 person-years of follow-up. Fibre intake was inversely associated with CRC risk (P(trend) = 0.026). Concerning colon cancer, we observed borderline interaction between fibre intake and sex (P = 0.052) and significant protective association restricted to women (P(trend) = 0.013). Intake of fruits and berries was inversely associated with colon cancer in women (P(trend) = 0.022). We also observed significant interactions between intakes of fibre (P = 0.048) and vegetables (P = 0.039) and sex on rectal cancer, but no significant associations were seen between intake of fibre, or its sources, in either of the sexes. Except for inverse associations between intake of fibre-rich cereal products and N0- and M0-tumours, we did not observe significant associations with different TNM stages. Our findings suggest different associations between fibre intake and CRC depending on sex, tumour site and fibre source. High fibre intake, especially from fruits and berries, may, above all, prevent tumour development in the colon in women. No clear differences by TNM classification were detected.},

The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to estimate the incidence of advanced neoplasia after initial colonoscopy and compare the differences among risk groups.
METHODS: Patients over 40 years who were referred for initial colonoscopy at six institutes were selected. They were classified into four groups based on the initial colonoscopy: A, patients without any adenoma; B, with adenomas of {\textless}6 mm only; C, with adenomas of {\textgreater}or=6 mm; D, with any intramucosal cancer. The index lesion (IL) at follow-up colonoscopy was defined as large adenoma {\textgreater}or=10 mm, intramucosal/invasive cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 5309 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall, median follow-up period was 5.1 years. The numbers of eligible patients in the various subgroups were A, 2006; B, 1655; C, 1123; D, 525. A total of 379 ILs were newly diagnosed during follow-up colonoscopy. The cumulative incidence of ILs in each group was A, 2.6\%; B, 6.7\%; C, 13.4\%; and D, 12.6\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with any adenomas {\textgreater}6 mm or intramucosal cancer at the initial colonoscopy have a higher risk of advanced neoplasia during follow-up colonoscopy.},

	issn = {1527-7755},
	abstract = {3602 Background: Early identification of patients at increased risk for recurrence remains a central issue in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Altered expression levels in cancer-related genes have emerged as potential markers in determining risk of recurrence. However, due to the large and complex variety of pathways that influence colon cancer progression, a set of molecular markers has not been established as a basis for clinical prognosis. The use of microarray technology addresses this problem by taking a comprehensive approach to examining gene expression rather than a restricted pathway approach. We analyzed gene expression profiles of 38 colorectal cancer patients using microarrays to determine differential expression patterns of recurrence versus recurrence-free patients.
METHODS: 38 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were selected, of which 14 experienced recurrence and 24 did not. RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tumor tissue and microarray analysis was conducted using Affymetrix U133A genechip containing 22,000 probe sets. Cluster analysis was performed to differentiate between recurrence and recurrence-free patients. In addition, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM analysis) was conducted to establish an expression profile based on recurrence. Genes with a greater than 1.5 fold difference in expression from the standard deviation were considered significant, with a false discovery rate of less than 10\%.
RESULTS: By SAM analysis, 87 genes were found significantly differentially expressed in recurrence vs. non-recurrence patients. The 87 genes do not all associate functionally but rather are involved in a variety of cancer-related pathways, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and cell adhesion. Additionally, clustering showed a mild correlation between recurrence and recurrence-free patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the ability of expression profiling using microarrays to predict recurrence in colorectal cancer. Expression profiling may be used in combination with traditional pathologic staging to more accurately characterize disease status and hence individualize treatment at the genetic level.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with stage I colorectal cancer (CRC) rarely experience recurrences; therefore, few risk factors for recurrence are known. This study was designed to evaluate oncologic outcomes of patients with stage I CRC and to identify risk factors for recurrence after curative surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 860 patients from a single institution who underwent curative surgery for stage I CRC between July 1995 and June 2010 was enrolled. Patients who were diagnosed with hereditary, synchronous, or metachronous cancer and those who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy were excluded. Patients from whom fewer than 12 lymph nodes were retrieved were also excluded.
RESULTS: The 860 patients included 402 (46.7\%) with colon tumors and 458 (53.3\%) with rectal tumors. Thirty-five patients (4.1\%) experienced recurrences; local and systemic recurrence rates were 1.1 and 3.0\%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 93.5 ± 0.8\% and 95.7 ± 0.8\%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) concentration ≥6 ng/mL (hazard ratio [HR] 3.354, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.373-8.195, p = 0.008) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (HR 2.676, 95\% CI 1.097-6.531, p = 0.031) were independent risk factors for RFS.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall recurrence rate among patients with stage I CRC after curative surgery was 4.1\%. Elevated serum CEA and LVI were significantly associated with recurrence. Large-scale, multicenter studies are needed to confirm the prognostic value of these risk factors.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiota is important in maintaining human health, but numerous factors have the potential to alter its composition. Our aim was to examine the impact of a standard bowel preparation on the intestinal microbiota using two different techniques. Fifteen subjects undergoing colonoscopy consumed a bowel preparation comprised of 10 mg bisacodyl and 2 L polyethylene glycol. The microbiota of stool samples, collected one month before, one week before (pre-colonoscopy), and one week, one month, and three to six months after colonoscopy (post-colonoscopy) was evaluated. Two samples were taken three to six months apart from five healthy subjects who did not undergo colonoscopy. Universal primers targeting the V2-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene were used to PCR amplify all samples for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Pre- and post-colonoscopy samples were compared using Dice's similarity coefficients. Three samples from ten subjects who underwent colonoscopy, and both samples from the five subjects who didn't, were used for high-throughput sequencing of the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Samples were curated and analysed in Mothur. Results of the DGGE analyses show that the fecal microbiota of a small number of subjects had short-term changes. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that the variation between the samples of subjects who underwent colonoscopy was no greater than the variation observed between samples from subjects who did not. We conclude that bowel preparation does not have a lasting effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiota for the majority of subjects.},

The composition of gut microbiota and SCFA levels were significantly different between the five diet groups.

High-throughput sequencing revealed that inflammation modifies gut microbial composition in colitis-susceptible interleukin-10-deficient (Il10(-/-)) mice. Monocolonization with the commensal Escherichia coli NC101 promoted invasive carcinoma in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated Il10(-/-) mice. Deletion of the polyketide synthase (pks) genotoxic island from E. coli NC101 decreased tumor multiplicity and invasion in AOM/Il10(-/-) mice, without altering intestinal inflammation. Mucosa-associated pks(+) E. coli were found in a significantly high percentage of inflammatory bowel disease and CRC patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although colonoscopic surveillance of patients after removal of adenomas is widely promoted, little is known about colorectal-cancer mortality among these patients.
METHODS: Using the linkage of the Cancer Registry and the Cause of Death Registry of Norway, we estimated colorectal-cancer mortality among patients who had undergone removal of colorectal adenomas during the period from 1993 through 2007. Patients were followed through 2011. We calculated standardized incidence-based mortality ratios (SMRs) using rates for the Norwegian population at large for comparison. Norwegian guidelines recommended colonoscopy after 10 years for patients with high-risk adenomas (adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, a villous component, or a size ≥10 mm) and after 5 years for patients with three or more adenomas; no surveillance was recommended for patients with low-risk adenomas. Polyp size and exact number were not available in the registry. We defined high-risk adenomas as multiple adenomas and adenomas with a villous component or high-grade dysplasia.
RESULTS: We identified 40,826 patients who had had colorectal adenomas removed. During a median follow-up of 7.7 years (maximum, 19.0), 1273 patients were given a diagnosis of colorectal cancer. A total of 398 deaths from colorectal cancer were expected and 383 were observed, for an SMR of 0.96 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.06) among patients who had had adenomas removed. Colorectal-cancer mortality was increased among patients with high-risk adenomas (expected deaths, 209; observed deaths, 242; SMR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.02 to 1.31), but it was reduced among patients with low-risk adenomas (expected deaths, 189; observed deaths, 141; SMR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.63 to 0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: After a median of 7.7 years of follow-up, colorectal-cancer mortality was lower among patients who had had low-risk adenomas removed and moderately higher among those who had had high-risk adenomas removed, as compared with the general population.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening by multi-target stool DNA (MT-sDNA) show false positive (FP) rates of 7-13\%. It is unclear whether FP patients are at increased long-term risk of adverse outcomes.
METHODS: We compared subsequent clinical events among patients with apparent FP MT-sDNA to those in patients reported as true negative (TN). This was a retrospective cohort study of participants in pre-FDA approval MT-sDNA studies having non-advanced or negative baseline colonoscopy findings from a single referral-center. Per-protocol and calibrated cutoffs defined FP and TN groups. From the time of stool collection, we measured differences between FP and TN groups in time to death, subsequent cancer diagnosis and onset of alarm symptoms.
RESULTS: Of 1050 eligible patients, only 6 were lost to follow-up. Median age was 65.6 years (IQR, 56.8, 72.3); 54\% were female. Median follow-up time was 4 years (IQR, 3.5-5.3). Eight aerodigestive (lung \& gastrointestinal tract) cancers occurred. FP status by calibrated, but not per-protocol cut-offs was associated with subsequent aerodigestive cancer; however, cumulative incidence did not exceed SEER expectations from the general population. By any cut-off method, FP status was not associated with mortality or alarm symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: While FP status was associated with long-term aerodigestive cancers, new cases were not temporally related and did not exceed incidence estimates from general population.
IMPACT: These observations do not justify aggressive follow-up evaluation for patients with FP MT-sDNA at this time. Larger studies are needed to confirm these early findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence for surveillance intervals of colonoscopy are primarily based on adenoma recurrence rate rather than on colorectal cancer (C.R.C.) incidence. Little is known about long-term risk of C.R.C. after positive colonoscopy. In view of men have significantly higher C.R.C. risk than women, we aimed to estimate the gender-specific C.R.C. incidence after positive colonoscopy (adenoma or malignant lesion) at follow-up colonoscopy.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from a database of colonoscopy screening and surveillance. Patients having had a colonoscopy (January 2010-March 2014) were selected as study subjects and the history of prior colonoscopies was reviewed. Multivariable Weibull regression models were used to estimate the incidence of C.R.C. at follow-up colonoscopy for subjects who were assigned a stratified risk level. The benchmark risk was defined according to a national survey.
RESULTS: The interval incidence of C.R.C. at a 10 year follow-up was 164 (95\% C.I. 63-343) and 79 (95\% C.I. 26-188) per 100,000 person-years for low-risk men and women respectively, which tallied with our benchmark risk. Men exceeded the benchmark risk in 3-5 years if they had an incomplete polyp removal, ≥3 adenomas during their last colonoscopy or a personal C.R.C. history, and in 7-8 years if they only had familial C.R.C.
HISTORY: Women had a lower risk of C.R.C., and reached a same risk level 3-5 years later than men. Coexisting above risk factors resulted in a sharp increase in the incidence of C.R.C. at follow-up exceeding the benchmark much earlier.
CONCLUSION: Surveillance intervals for men based on incidence of C.R.C. are in line with that recommended by the current guidelines for colonoscopy. However, an extension of 3-5 years may be appropriate for women. To target personalized medicine, a risk predictive model could be used to identify an appropriate surveillance interval for each individual in the future.},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that individuals with colonic adenomas and carcinomas harbor a distinct microbiota. Alterations to the gut microbiota may allow the outgrowth of bacterial populations that induce genomic mutations or exacerbate tumor-promoting inflammation. In addition, it is likely that the loss of key bacterial populations may result in the loss of protective functions that are normally provided by the microbiota. We explored the role of the gut microbiota in colon tumorigenesis by using an inflammation-based murine model. We observed that perturbing the microbiota with different combinations of antibiotics reduced the number of tumors at the end of the model. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we successfully modeled the number of tumors that developed over the course of the model on the basis of the initial composition of the microbiota. The timing of antibiotic treatment was an important determinant of tumor outcome, as colon tumorigenesis was arrested by the use of antibiotics during the early inflammation period of the murine model. Together, these results indicate that it is possible to predict colon tumorigenesis on the basis of the composition of the microbiota and that altering the gut microbiota can alter the course of tumorigenesis. IMPORTANCE Mounting evidence indicates that alterations to the gut microbiota, the complex community of bacteria that inhabits the gastrointestinal tract, are strongly associated with the development of colorectal cancer. We used antibiotic perturbations to a murine model of inflammation-driven colon cancer to generate eight starting communities that resulted in various severities of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we were able to quantitatively predict the final number of tumors on the basis of the initial composition of the gut microbiota. These results further bolster the evidence that the gut microbiota is involved in mediating the development of colorectal cancer. As a final proof of principle, we showed that perturbing the gut microbiota in the midst of tumorigenesis could halt the formation of additional tumors. Together, alteration of the gut microbiota may be a useful therapeutic approach to preventing and altering the trajectory of colorectal cancer.},

Rats were fed a control diet or diets containing 10\% RS, 0.5\% GTE or a combination of the two (RS + GTE). CAC was initiated with 2 weekly azoxymethane (AOM) injections (10mg/kg) followed by 2\% dextran sodium sulphate in drinking water for 7 days after 2 weeks on diets. Rats were killed 20 weeks after the first AOM. Colon tissues and tumours were examined for histopathology by H\&E, gene/protein expression by PCR and immunohistochemistry and digesta for analyses of fermentation products and microbiota populations. RS and RS + GTE (but not GTE) diets significantly (P{\textless} 0.05) decreased tumour multiplicity and adenocarcinoma formation, relative to the control diet. Effects of RS + GTE were not different from RS alone. RS diet caused significant shifts in microbial composition/diversity, with increases in Parabacteroides, Barnesiella, Ruminococcus, Marvinbryantia and Bifidobacterium as primary contributors to the shift. RS-containing diets increased short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and expression of the SCFA receptor GPR43 mRNA, and reduced inflammation (COX-2, NF-kB, TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA) and cell proliferation P{\textless} 0.05. GTE had no effect. This is the first study that demonstrates chemopreventive effects of RS (but not GTE) in a rodent CAC model, suggesting RS might have benefit to patients with ulcerative colitis who are at an increased risk of developing CRC.},

A broader view of oral bacterial physiology and pathogenesis identifies two factors that could promote colonization and persistence of oral bacterial communities in the colon. The polymicrobial nature of oral biofilms and the asaccharolytic metabolism of many of these species make them well suited to life in the microenvironment of colonic lesions. Consideration of these two factors offers a novel perspective on the role of oral microbiota in the initiation, development, and treatment of colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC) from faecal metagenomes.
DESIGN: We performed metagenome-wide association studies on faecal samples from 74 patients with CRC and 54 controls from China, and validated the results in 16 patients and 24 controls from Denmark. We further validated the biomarkers in two published cohorts from France and Austria. Finally, we employed targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to evaluate diagnostic potential of selected biomarkers in an independent Chinese cohort of 47 patients and 109 controls.
RESULTS: Besides confirming known associations of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis with CRC, we found significant associations with several species, including Parvimonas micra and Solobacterium moorei. We identified 20 microbial gene markers that differentiated CRC and control microbiomes, and validated 4 markers in the Danish cohort. In the French and Austrian cohorts, these four genes distinguished CRC metagenomes from controls with areas under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. qPCR measurements of two of these genes accurately classified patients with CRC in the independent Chinese cohort with AUC=0.84 and OR of 23. These genes were enriched in early-stage (I-II) patient microbiomes, highlighting the potential for using faecal metagenomic biomarkers for early diagnosis of CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first metagenomic profiling study of CRC faecal microbiomes to discover and validate microbial biomarkers in ethnically different cohorts, and to independently validate selected biomarkers using an affordable clinically relevant technology. Our study thus takes a step further towards affordable non-invasive early diagnostic biomarkers for CRC from faecal samples.},

Experiments with mono-colonized Il10(-/-) mice reveal that host inflammation is necessary for E. coli cancer-promoting activity. RNA-sequence analysis indicates significant changes in E. coli gene catalogue in Il10(-/-) mice, with changes mostly driven by adaptation to the intestinal environment. Expression of specific genes present in the tumour-promoting E. coli pks island are modulated by inflammation/CRC development. Thus, progression of inflammation in Il10(-/-) mice supports Enterobacteriaceae and alters a small subset of microbial genes important for tumour development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death among cancers in the United States. Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater than 90\% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota associated with the progression of CRC, suggesting that the gut microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
METHODS: We sequenced the 16S rRNA genes from the stool samples of 490 patients. We used the relative abundances of the bacterial populations within each sample to develop a random forest classification model that detects colonic lesions using the relative abundance of gut microbiota and the concentration of hemoglobin in stool.
RESULTS: The microbiota-based random forest model detected 91.7\% of cancers and 45.5\% of adenomas while FIT alone detected 75.0\% and 15.7\%, respectively. Of the colonic lesions missed by FIT, the model detected 70.0\% of cancers and 37.7\% of adenomas. We confirmed known associations of Porphyromonas assaccharolytica, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum with CRC. Yet, we found that the loss of potentially beneficial organisms, such as members of the Lachnospiraceae, was more predictive for identifying patients with adenomas when used in combination with FIT.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the potential for microbiota analysis to complement existing screening methods to improve detection of colonic lesions.},

	abstract = {Environmental factors clearly affect colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, but the mechanisms through which these factors function are unknown. One prime candidate is an altered colonic microbiota. Here we show that the mucosal microbiota organization is a critical factor associated with a subset of CRC. We identified invasive polymicrobial bacterial biofilms (bacterial aggregates), structures previously associated with nonmalignant intestinal pathology, nearly universally (89\%) on right-sided tumors (13 of 15 CRCs, 4 of 4 adenomas) but on only 12\% of left-sided tumors (2 of 15 CRCs, 0 of 2 adenomas). Surprisingly, patients with biofilm-positive tumors, whether cancers or adenomas, all had biofilms on their tumor-free mucosa far distant from their tumors. Bacterial biofilms were associated with diminished colonic epithelial cell E-cadherin and enhanced epithelial cell IL-6 and Stat3 activation, as well as increased crypt epithelial cell proliferation in normal colon mucosa. High-throughput sequencing revealed no consistent bacterial genus associated with tumors, regardless of biofilm status. However, principal coordinates analysis revealed that biofilm communities on paired normal mucosa, distant from the tumor itself, cluster with tumor microbiomes as opposed to biofilm-negative normal mucosa bacterial communities also from the tumor host. Colon mucosal biofilm detection may predict increased risk for development of sporadic CRC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Multi-target stool DNA testing (MT-sDNA) is now FDA-approved for average-risk CRC screening. Trials leading to its approval used blinded colonoscopy as the reference standard. In the post-approval screen setting, the clinical performance and impact of MT-sDNA on unblinded colonoscopy has not been described. We measured the impact that knowledge of a positive MT-sDNA test result has on colonoscopy yield and quality.
METHODS: The unblinded group comprised all patients with positive MT-sDNA results on screening from 9/1/14-9/30/15 at a single tertiary center. Off-label test patients were excluded. The blinded group included all MT-sDNA positive participants in a pre-approval screening study from the same center. Detailed colonoscopy findings and withdrawal times were recorded.
RESULTS: There were 172 MT-sDNA positive patients in the unblinded group and 72 in the blinded group. More total adenomatous/sessile serrated polyps (70\% vs 53\%, p=0.013) and advanced neoplasms (28\% vs 21\%, p=0.27) were detected in unblinded than blinded groups. Median numbers of polyps detected were 2 (interquartile range, 1 - 4) and 1 (0 - 2) in unblinded and blinded groups, respectively (p=0.0007). Among polyps detected, flat or slightly raised lesions in the right colon were proportionately more frequent with unblinded (40\%) than blinded examinasions (9\%) (p=0.0017). Median withdrawal time was 19 min (13 - 29) in the unblinded group compared with 13 min (10 - 20) in the blinded group (p=0.0001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The long-term natural history of early stage colon cancer and the outcome of long-term colonoscopic surveillance in routine specialist clinical practice after removal of the incident cancers have not been fully defined. In the present long-term evaluation up to 25 years, metachronous neoplasia, including both advanced adenomas and carcinomas, was defined.
METHODS: All early stage colorectal cancer patients evaluated consecutively from a single clinical practice underwent follow-up colonoscopic evaluations after removal of the incident cancer and clearing of neoplastic disease. Colonoscopic surveillance was planned for two phases - initially on an annual basis for five years, followed by continued surveillance every three years up to 25 years with removal of any metachronous neoplastic lesion.
RESULTS: A total of 128 patients (66 men and 62 women) with 129 incident early stage colorectal cancers were evaluated. Virtually all patients were symptomatic, usually with clinical evidence of blood loss. Incident early cancers were located throughout the colon, especially in the rectosigmoid, and showed no pathological evidence of nodal or other metastases. All patients evaluated during the first five years did not experience recurrent disease or have metachronous cancer detected. After five years, a total of 94 patients were evaluated up to 25 years; six of these patients were found to have seven metachronous colon cancers. All developed cancer more than seven years after removal of the incident colorectal cancer, including six asymptomatic adenocarcinomas, of which only one had evidence of single node involvement. Another patient in this cohort developed a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the colon. In addition, 45\% of patients had a total of 217 adenomas removed, including 11\% of patients with 33 advanced adenomas. Among 14 patients with advanced adenomas, seven (50\%) developed ≥1 late metachronous cancers.
CONCLUSIONS: Following removal of an incident symptomatic early stage colorectal cancer, the risk of later metachronous neoplasia persists for an extended period more than five years after removal of the incident colorectal cancer. Moreover, risk for late metachronous cancer appears to be predicted by the presence of multiple adenomas or advanced adenomas; most metachronous cancers in this cohort were detected using colonoscopy before onset of symptoms and at an early stage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Three large randomised trials have shown that screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) using the faecal occult blood test (FOBt) can reduce the mortality from this disease. The largest of these trials, conducted in Nottingham since 1981, randomised 152,850 individuals between the ages of 45 and 74 years to an intervention arm receiving biennial Haemoccult (FOB) test kit or to a control arm. In 2006, the National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme was launched in England using the FOBt, with the expectation that it will reduce CRC mortality.
AIMS: To compare the CRC mortality and incidence in the intervention arm with the control arm after long-term follow-up.
METHODS: The 152,850 randomised individuals were followed up through local health records and central flagging (Office for National Statistics).
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 19.5 years there was a 13\% reduction in CRC mortality (95\% CI 3\% to 22\%) in the intervention arm despite an uptake at first invitation of approximately 57\%. The CRC mortality reduction in those accepting the first screening test, adjusted for the rate of non-compliers, was 18\%. There was no significant difference in mortality from causes other than CRC between the intervention and control arms. Despite removing 615 adenomas {\textgreater}10 mm in size from the intervention arm, there was no significant difference in CRC incidence between the two arms.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the reduction in CRC mortality was sustained, further follow-up of the screened population has not shown a significant reduction in the CRC incidence. Moreover, despite the removal of many large adenomas there was no reduction in the incidence of invasive cancer which was independent of sex and site of the tumour.},

Here, we used metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved {\textgreater} 45\% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early- and late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide metabolism.},

We have hypothesized that diet influences the health of the colonic mucosa through interaction with the microbiota and that it is the milieu interior that regulates mucosal proliferation and therefore cancer risk. To validate this further, we compared colonic contents from healthy 50- to 65-y-old people from populations with high and low risk, specifically low risk Native Africans (cancer incidence {\textless}1:100,000; n = 17), high risk African Americans (risk 65:100,000; n = 17), and Caucasian Americans (risk 50:100,000; n = 18). Americans typically consume a high-animal protein and -fat diet, whereas Africans consume a staple diet of maize meal, rich in resistant starch and low in animal products. Following overnight fasting, rapid colonic evacuation was performed with 2 L polyethylene glycol. Total colonic evacuants were analyzed for SCFA, vitamins, nitrogen, and minerals. Total SCFA and butyrate were significantly higher in Native Africans than in both American groups. Colonic folate and biotin content, measured by Lactobacillus rhamnoses and Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 8014 bioassay, respectively, exceeded normal daily dietary intakes. Compared with Africans, calcium and iron contents were significantly higher in Caucasian Americans and zinc content was significantly higher in African Americans, but nitrogen content did not differ among the 3 groups. In conclusion, the results support our hypothesis that the microbiota mediates the effect diet has on colon cancer risk by their generation of butyrate, folate, and biotin, molecules known to play a key role in the regulation of epithelial proliferation.},

	abstract = {Incidence rates for colorectal cancer are decreasing in the United States, possibly due to preventative cancer screening. Because these programs target older patients, their beneficial effects may not apply to young patients. The purpose of this study was to compare incidence rates and tumor characteristics of colon and rectal cancers for young versus older patients using a population-based cancer registry. Colon and rectal cancer patients reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (1973-1999) were separately analyzed. Incidence rates over time, stage, and grade were compared for two age groups: young patients (20-40 years, n = 5383) and older patients (60+ years, n = 256,401). For older patients, colon cancer incidence remained stable while rectal cancer incidence decreased 11 per cent to 72.1/100,000 persons (P {\textless} 0.05). For the young, colon cancer incidence increased 17 per cent to 2.1 (P {\textless} 0.05), and rectal incidence rose 75 per cent to 1.4 (P {\textless} 0.05). Young patients had less localized tumors than older patients: colon (25.8\% vs. 35.3\%, P {\textless} 0.001); rectal (38.4\% vs. 41.7\%, P = 0.005). Young patients also had more poorly differentiated tumors: colon (22.2\% vs. 14.7\%, P {\textless} 0.001); rectal (16.4\% vs. 12.3\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Incidence rates for colon and rectal cancers in young patients are rising, and they have more advanced disease. Although the overall prevalence is low in this population, the increasing incidence suggests health-care providers should have heightened awareness when caring for this population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the impact of municipality of residence on colonoscopic surveillance and colorectal cancer risk after adenoma resection in a French well-defined administrative area.
METHODS: This registry-based study included all patients residing in Côte d'Or (n=5769) first diagnosed with colorectal adenomas between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1999. Information about colonoscopic surveillance and colorectal cancer incidence was collected until December 31, 2003.
RESULTS: A rural place of residence reduced the probability of colonoscopic surveillance in men [HR=0.89 (95\%CI: 0.79-0.99), p=0.041] and in patients without family history of colorectal cancer [HR=0.91(0.82-0.99), p=0.044]. After a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 87 patients developed invasive colorectal cancer. After advanced adenoma removal, the standardized incidence ratio for colorectal cancer was 3.03 (95\%CI: 1.92-4.54) for rural patients and 1.87 (95\%CI: 1.26-2.66) for urban patients compared with the general population. The risk of colorectal cancer was higher in rural patients than in urban ones only after removal of the initial advanced adenoma [HR=1.73 (95\%CI: 1.01-3.00, p=0.048)]. Further adjustment for surveillance colonoscopy, physician location, and other confounders had little impact on these results.
CONCLUSION: The increased risk of subsequent colorectal cancer after advanced adenoma removal in French rural patients was not explained by a lower rate of colonoscopic surveillance. The role of socio-economic and environmental factors requires further exploration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the higher burden from colorectal cancer among blacks is due to an increased biological susceptibility.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) have a higher risk of adenoma recurrence than non-Hispanic whites (whites) after removal of colorectal adenoma.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT) data.
SETTING: United States.
PATIENTS: Patients were 1668 self-identified whites and 153 blacks who completed the 4-year trial. Of these, 688 whites and 55 blacks enrolled in a posttrial, passive Polyp Prevention Trial Continued Follow-up Study (PPT-CFS) and underwent another colonoscopy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Recurrence and location of the adenoma and advanced adenoma by race-ethnicity during PPT and cumulative recurrence over a mean follow-up of 8.3 years (range, 4.9-12.4 years) among PPT-CFS enrollees.
RESULTS: Blacks had similar risk of recurrence of adenoma (39.2\% vs 39.4\%; incidence risk ratio [RR] = .98; 95\% CI, .80-1.20) and advanced adenoma (8.5\% vs 6.4\%; RR = 1.18; 95\% CI, .68-2.05) as whites at the end of PPT. Recurrence risk did not differ by colon subsite. Among PPT-CFS enrollees, the cumulative recurrence rate over a maximal follow-up period of 12 years was similar for blacks and whites for adenoma (67.3\% vs 67.0\%; RR = 1.01; 95\% CI, .84-1.21) and advanced adenoma (14.5\% vs 16.9\%; RR = 1.03; 95\% CI, .60-1.79).
LIMITATION: There were few blacks in the long-term follow-up study.
CONCLUSIONS: Adenoma and advanced adenoma recurrence did not differ by race. Our study does not support more frequent surveillance colonoscopies for blacks with a personal history of adenoma as an intervention to reduce colorectal cancer disparity.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of an HPD on the microbiota, microbial metabolites, and epithelial transcriptome in the colons of rats.
METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were fed either a normal-protein diet (20\% protein, 56\% carbohydrate) or an HPD (45\% protein, 30\% carbohydrate) for 6 wk (n = 10 rats per group, individually fed). After 6 wk, the colonic microbiome, microbial metabolites, and epithelial transcriptome were determined.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal-protein diet, the HPD adversely altered the colonic microbiota by increasing (P {\textless} 0.05) Escherichia/Shigella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and sulfate-reducing bacteria by 54.9-fold, 31.3-fold, 5.36-fold, and 2.59-fold, respectively. However, the HPD reduced Ruminococcus (8.04-fold), Akkermansia (not detected in HPD group), and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (3.5-fold) (P {\textless} 0.05), which are generally regarded as beneficial bacteria in the colon. Concomitant increases in cadaverine (4.88-fold), spermine (31.2-fold), and sulfide (4.8-fold) (P {\textless} 0.05) and a decrease in butyrate (2.16-fold) (P {\textless} 0.05) in the HPD rats indicated an evident shift toward the production of unhealthy microbial metabolites. In the colon epithelium of the HPD rats, transcriptome analysis identified an upregulation of genes (P {\textless} 0.05) involved in disease pathogenesis; these genes are involved in chemotaxis, the tumor necrosis factor signal process, and apoptosis. The HPD was also associated with a downregulation of many genes (P {\textless} 0.05) involved in immunoprotection, such as genes involved in innate immunity, O-linked glycosylation of mucin, and oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting there may be an increased disease risk in these rats. The abundance of Escherichia/Shigella, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus was positively correlated (Spearman's ρ {\textgreater} 0.7, P {\textless} 0.05) with genes and metabolites generally regarded as being involved in disease pathogenesis, suggesting these bacteria may mediate the detrimental effects of HPDs on colonic health.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the HPD altered the colonic microbial community, shifted the metabolic profile, and affected the host response in the colons of rats toward an increased risk of colonic disease.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that individuals with colorectal cancer have an altered gut microbiome compared to healthy controls. It remains unclear whether these differences are a response to tumorigenesis or actively drive tumorigenesis. To determine the role of the gut microbiome in the development of colorectal cancer, we characterized the gut microbiome in a murine model of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer that mirrors what is seen in humans. We followed the development of an abnormal microbial community structure associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis in the colon. Tumor-bearing mice showed enrichment in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated with members of the Bacteroides, Odoribacter, and Akkermansia genera and decreases in OTUs affiliated with members of the Prevotellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families. Conventionalization of germfree mice with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice significantly increased tumorigenesis in the colon compared to that for animals colonized with a healthy gut microbiome from untreated mice. Furthermore, at the end of the model, germfree mice colonized with microbiota from tumor-bearing mice harbored a higher relative abundance of populations associated with tumor formation in conventional animals. Manipulation of the gut microbiome with antibiotics resulted in a dramatic decrease in both the number and size of tumors. Our results demonstrate that changes in the gut microbiome associated with inflammation and tumorigenesis directly contribute to tumorigenesis and suggest that interventions affecting the composition of the microbiome may be a strategy to prevent the development of colon cancer.
IMPORTANCE: The trillions of bacteria that live in the gut, known collectively as the gut microbiome, are important for normal functioning of the intestine. There is now growing evidence that disruptive changes in the gut microbiome are strongly associated with the development colorectal cancer. However, how the gut microbiome changes with time during tumorigenesis and whether these changes directly contribute to disease have not been determined. We demonstrate using a mouse model of inflammation-driven colon cancer that there are dramatic, continual alterations in the microbiome during the development of tumors, which are directly responsible for tumor development. Our results suggest that interventions that target these changes in the microbiome may be an effective strategy for preventing the development of colorectal cancer.},

Abnormalities in the gut microbiome have been reported in patients with colorectal cancer; however, this microbial community has not been explored as a potential screen for early-stage disease. We characterized the gut microbiome in patients from three clinical groups representing the stages of colorectal cancer development: healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma. Analysis of the gut microbiome from stool samples revealed both an enrichment and depletion of several bacterial populations associated with adenomas and carcinomas. Combined with known clinical risk factors of colorectal cancer (e.g., BMI, age, race), data from the gut microbiome significantly improved the ability to differentiate between healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma clinical groups relative to risk factors alone. Using Bayesian methods, we determined that using gut microbiome data as a screening tool improved the pretest to posttest probability of adenoma more than 50-fold. For example, the pretest probability in a 65-year-old was 0.17\% and, after using the microbiome data, this increased to 10.67\% (1 in 9 chance of having an adenoma). Taken together, the results of our study demonstrate the feasibility of using the composition of the gut microbiome to detect the presence of precancerous and cancerous lesions. Furthermore, these results support the need for more cross-sectional studies with diverse populations and linkage to other stool markers, dietary data, and personal health information.},

In a 5-year period we examined every case of CRC diagnosed under the age of 75 years and obtained consent from 730 cases. Careful analysis of family history was used to assign a familial cancer risk, based on established criteria. We observed that 3.7\% of CRC cases came from families meeting the Amsterdam II criteria and a further 0.9\% of cases involved familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). An additional 43\% of cases met one or more of the revised Bethesda criteria and 31\% of all cases had a first-degree relative affected with CRC. We compared the Newfoundland data with data from the province of Ontario, where the same recruitment and risk-assessment criteria were used. In all categories, the indicators of familial risk were significantly higher in Newfoundland. These data were also compared to results published from 13 other population-based studies worldwide. In every category the proportion of Newfoundland cases meeting the criteria was higher than in any other population. The mean differences were: 3.5-fold greater for FAP, 2.8-fold higher for Amsterdam criteria, 2.0-fold higher for Bethesda criteria and 1.9-fold higher for the number of affected first-degree relatives. We conclude that the high incidence of CRC in Newfoundland may be attributable to genetic, or at least familial, factors. In the high-risk families we provide evidence for the involvement of founder mutations in the APC and MSH2 genes.},
