\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\textbf{Background.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Colorectal cancer is a worldwide health problem.
}\DIFdelend Despite growing evidence that members of the gut
microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is known about what happens
to it after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tested the hypothesis that
treatment for adenoma or carcinoma }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tests
whether treatment }\DIFaddend alters the abundance of bacterial populations
associated with disease \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to those associated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{versus those }\DIFaddend with a normal colon \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. We tested this hypothesis }\DIFdelend by sequencing
the 16S rRNA genes in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the
}\DIFdelend feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for adenoma (N }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(adenoma n }\DIFaddend = 22), advanced adenoma \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(N }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{n }\DIFaddend = 19), and carcinoma \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(N }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{n }\DIFaddend = 26).

\textbf{Results.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{There were small changes to the bacterial community
associated with adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated
with carcinoma. }\DIFdelend The communities from patients with carcinomas changed
significantly more than those with adenoma following treatment (P-value
\textless{} 0.001). Although \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{treatment was associated with intrapersonal
changes, the change in the abundance of individual OTUs in response to
treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P-value
\textgreater{} 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients
and diagnosis groups was irregular, we used the Random Forest machine
learning algorithm to identify groups of OTUs that could be used to
classify }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Random Forest models classified }\DIFaddend pre and
post-treatment samples for each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the diagnosis groups. Although the three models could differentiate between the pre
and post-treatment samples}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{diagnosis group}\DIFaddend , there was little
overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To determine whether individuals
who underwent treatment were more likely to have OTUs associated with
normal colons we used }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Training Random Forest models on }\DIFaddend a larger cohort that contained
individuals with normal colons\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and those with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend adenomas, advanced adenomas, and
carcinomas \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. We again built Random Forest models and measured the change
in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we assessed }\DIFaddend the positive probability of having one of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the three
diagnoses to
assess whether the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{three
diagnoses and whether the pre and }\DIFaddend post-treatment samples \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{received the sameclassification as the pre-treatment samples. Samples from patients }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were classified
the same. Patients }\DIFaddend who had carcinomas changed towards a microbial milieu
that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P-value \textless{}
0.05). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, we
were unable to detect any significant differences }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There was no significant difference }\DIFaddend in the microbiota of
individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with
chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation (P-value \textgreater{}
0.05).

\textbf{Conclusions.} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{By better understanding the response of the
microbiota to treatment for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that
biomarkers will eventually be validated that can be used to quantify the
risk of recurrence and the likelihood of survival. Although it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It }\DIFaddend was difficult to identify significant
differences between pre and post-treatment samples from patients with
adenoma and advanced adenoma\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{,
this was not the case for carcinomas. Not }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. However, for carcinomas, not }\DIFaddend only were
there large changes in pre versus post-treatment samples\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for those with carcinoma}\DIFdelend , but these
changes were towards a more normal microbiota.

\DIFadd{This study helps to clarify what happens to the microbiota after
generalized treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. It is a necessary
first step to ultimately investigating how the microbiota changes in
those with carcinoma recurrence. This is important since a large number
of those treated for carcinoma will have a recurrence. Finding better
ways to stratify those most and least likely to recur using the
microbiota could provide a cheaper and more accurate alternative to the
current status quo. Our results suggest that the microbiota could be
used to stratify individuals for risk of recurrence and provides a
starting point for future studies into this area}\DIFaddend .

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer deaths
in the United States \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 1, 2\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . Disease mortality has significantly
decreased, predominately due to improvements in screening \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 2\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . Despite
these improvements, there are still approximately 50,000 CRC-related
deaths per year in the United States \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 1\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . Current estimates indicate
that 20-30\% of those who undergo treatment will experience recurrence
and 35\% of all patients will die within five years \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 3--5\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend .
Identification of methods to assess patients' risk of recurrence is of
great importance to reduce mortality and healthcare costs.

There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota is involved in the
progression of CRC. Mouse-based studies have identified populations of
\emph{Bacteroides fragilis}, \emph{Escherichia coli}, and
\emph{Fusobacterium nucleatum} that alter disease progression \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 6--10\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend .
Furthermore, studies that shift the structure of the microbiota through
the use of antibiotics or inoculation of germ free mice with human feces
have shown that varying community compositions can result in varied
tumor burden \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 11--13\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . Collectively, these studies support the
hypothesis that the microbiota can alter the amount of inflammation in
the colon and with it the rate of tumorigenesis \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 14\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend .

Building upon this evidence, several human studies have identified
unique signatures of colonic lesions \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 15--20\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . One line of research has
identified community-level differences between those bacteria that are
found on and adjacent to colonic lesions and have supported a role for
\emph{Bacteroides fragilis}, \emph{Escherichia coli}, and
\emph{Fusobacterium nucleatum} in tumorigenesis \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 21--23\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . Others have
proposed feces-based biomarkers that could be used to diagnose the
presence of colonic adenomas and carcinomas \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 24--26\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . These studies have
associated \emph{Fusobacterium nucleatum} and other oral pathogens with
colonic lesions (adenoma, advanced adenoma, and carcinoma). They have
also noted that the loss of bacteria generally thought to produce short
chain fatty acids, which can suppress inflammation, is associated with
colonic lesions. This suggests that gut bacteria have a role in
tumorigenesis with potential as useful biomarkers for aiding in the
early detection of disease \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 21--26\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend .

Despite advances in understanding the role between the gut microbiota
and colonic tumorigenesis, we still do not understand how treatments
including resection, chemotherapy, and/or radiation affect the
composition of the gut microbiota. If the microbial community drives
tumorigenesis then one would hypothesize that treatment to remove a
lesion would affect the microbiota and risk of recurrence. To test this
hypothesis, we addressed two related questions: Does treatment affect
the colonic microbiota in a predictable manner? If so, does the
treatment alter the community to more closely resemble that of
individuals with normal colons?

We answered these questions by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA
genes amplified from fecal samples of individuals with adenoma, advanced
adenoma, and carcinomas pre and post-treatment. We used classical
community analysis to compare the alpha and beta-diversity of
communities pre and post-treatment. Next, we generated Random Forest
models to identify bacterial populations that were indicative of
treatment for each diagnosis group. Finally, we measured the predictive
probabilities to assess whether treatment yielded bacterial communities
similar to those individuals with normal colons. We found that treatment
alters the composition of the gut microbiota and that, for those with
carcinomas, the gut microbiota shifted more towards that of a normal
colon after treatment. In the individuals with carcinomas, no difference
was found by the type of treatment (surgery alone, surgery with
chemotherapy, surgery with chemotherapy and radiation). Understanding
how the community responds to these treatments could be a valuable tool
for identifying biomarkers to quantify the risk of recurrence and the
likelihood of survival.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

\textbf{\emph{Treatment for colonic lesions alters the bacterial
community structure}} Within our 67-person cohort we tested whether the
microbiota of patients with adenoma (N = 22), advanced adenoma (N = 19),
or carcinoma (N = 26) had any broad differences between pre and
post-treatment samples {[}Table 1{]}. None of the individuals in this
study had any recorded antibiotic usage that was not associated with
surgical treatment of their respective lesion. The structure of the
microbial communities of the pre and post-treatment samples differed, as
measured by the \(\theta\)\textsubscript{YC} beta diversity metric
{[}Figure 1A{]}. We found that the communities obtained pre and
post-treatment among the patients with carcinomas changed significantly
more than those patients with adenoma (P-value \textless{} 0.001). There
were no significant differences in the amount of change observed between
the patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma or between the patients
with advanced adenoma and carcinoma (P-value \textgreater{} 0.05). Next,
we tested whether there was a consistent direction in the change in the
community structure between the pre and post-treatment samples for each
of the diagnosis groups {[}Figure 1B-D{]}. We only observed a consistent
shift in community structure for the patients with carcinoma when using
a PERMANOVA test (adenoma P-value = 0.999, advanced adenoma P-value =
0.945, and carcinoma P-value = 0.005). Finally, we measured the number
of observed OTUs, Shannon evenness, and Shannon diversity in the pre and
post-treatment samples and did not observe a significant change for any
of the diagnosis groups (P-value \textgreater{} 0.05) {[}Table S1{]}.

\textbf{\emph{The treatment of lesions are not consistent across
diagnosis groups.}} We used two approaches to identify those bacterial
populations that change between the two samples for each diagnosis
group. First, we sought to identify individual OTUs that could account
for the change in overall community structure. However, using a paired
Wilcoxon test we were unable to identify any OTUs that were
significantly different in the pre and post-treatment groups (P-value
\textgreater{} 0.05). It is likely that high inter-individual variation
and the irregular distribution of OTUs across individuals limited the
statistical power of the test. We attempted to overcome these problems
by using Random Forest models to identify collections of OTUs that would
allow us to differentiate between pre and post-treatment samples from
each of the diagnosis groups. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To limit the likelihood that the models
would over-fit the data because of the relatively small number of
subjects in each group, we restricted our models to only incorporate 10
OTUs. Despite this restriction,
the models performed well }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The models overall performed moderately,
with the carcinoma model being the best }\DIFaddend (adenoma AUC range = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.69 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.54 }\DIFaddend -
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.92}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.83}\DIFaddend , advanced adenoma AUC range = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.80 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.34 }\DIFaddend - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1.00}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.65}\DIFaddend , carcinoma AUC range =
0.82 - 0.98). Interestingly, the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{top }\DIFaddend 10 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OTUs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{most important OTUs by MDA }\DIFaddend that
were used for each model had little overlap with each other {[}Figure
2{]}. Although treatment had an impact on the overall community
structure, the effect of treatment was not consistent across patients
and diagnosis groups. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Both the adenoma and carcioma treatment models had
AUCs that were significantly higher than a random model permutation
(P-value \textless{} 0.0001).
}\DIFaddend 

\textbf{\emph{Post-treatment samples from patients with carcinoma more
closely resemble those of a normal colon.}} Next, we determined whether
treatment changed the microbiota in a way that the post-treatment
communities resembled that of patients with normal colons. To test this,
we used an expanded cohort of 423 individuals that were diagnosed under
the same protocol as having normal colons or colons with adenoma,
advanced adenoma, or carcinoma {[}Table 2{]}. We then constructed Random
Forest models to classify the study samples, with the 3 diagnosis groups
(adenoma, advanced adenoma, or carcinoma), or having a normal colon. The
models performed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{well }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{moderately with CRC being the best }\DIFaddend (adenoma AUC range =
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.62 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.50 }\DIFaddend - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.72}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.62}\DIFaddend , advanced adenoma AUC range = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.68 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.53 }\DIFaddend - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.77}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.67}\DIFaddend , carcinoma AUC
range = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.84 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.71 }\DIFaddend - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.90}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.82}\DIFaddend ; Figure S1). The OTUs that were \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{incorporated into }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in the top 10}\% \DIFadd{of
importance for }\DIFaddend the adenoma and advanced adenoma models largely
overlapped and those OTUs that were used to classify the carcinoma
samples were largely distinct from those of the other two models
{[}Figure 3A{]}. Among the OTUs that were shared across the three models
were those populations generally considered beneficial to their host
(e.g. \emph{Faecalibacterium}, \emph{Lachnospiraceae},
\emph{Bacteroides}, \emph{Dorea}, \emph{Anaerostipes}, and
\emph{Roseburia}) {[}Figures 3B{]}. Although many of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these OTUs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{important OTUs in
the top 10}\% \DIFaddend were also included in the model differentiating between
patients with normal colons and those with carcinoma, this model also
included OTUs affiliated with populations that have previously been
associated with carcinoma (\emph{Fusobacterium}, \emph{Porphyromonas},
\emph{Parvimonas}) \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 24--26\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) }\DIFaddend {[}Figure S2{]} with some individuals
showing a marked decrease in relative abundance {[}Figure S3{]}.
Finally, we applied these three models to the pre and post-treatment
samples for each diagnosis group and quantified the change in the
positive probability of the model. A decrease in the positive
probability would indicate that the microbiota more closely resembled
that of a patient with a normal colon. There was no significant change
in the positive probability for the adenoma or advanced adenoma groups
(P-value \textgreater{} 0.05) {[}Figure 4{]}. The positive probability
for the pre and post-treatment samples from patients diagnosed with
carcinoma significantly decreased with treatment, suggesting a shift
toward a normal microbiota for most individuals (P-value = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.02}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.001}\DIFaddend ). Only,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{7 }\DIFaddend of the 26 patients (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{23.08}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{26.92}\DIFaddend \%) who were diagnosed with a carcinoma had a
higher positive probability after treatment; one of those was
re-diagnosed with carcinoma on the follow up visit. These results
indicate that, although there were changes in the microbiota associated
with treatment, those experienced by patients with carcinoma after
treatment yielded gut bacterial communities of greater similarity to
that of a normal colon.

\textbf{\emph{Difficult to identify effects of specific treatments on
the change in the microbiota.}} The type of treatment that the patients
received varied across diagnosis groups. Those with adenomas and
advanced adenomas received surgical resection (adenoma, N=4; advanced
adenoma, N=4) or polyp removal during colonoscopy (adenoma, N=18;
advanced adenoma, N=15) and those with carcinomas received surgical
resection (N=12), surgical resection with chemotherapy (N=9), and
surgical resection with chemotherapy and radiation (N=5). Regardless of
treatment used there was no significant difference in the effect of
these treatments on the number of observed OTUs, Shannon diversity, or
Shannon evenness (P-value \textgreater{} 0.05). Furthermore, there was
not a significant difference in the effect of the treatments on the
amount of change in the community structure (P-value = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.532}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.375}\DIFaddend ). Finally,
the change in the positive probability was not significantly different
between any of the treatment groups (P-value = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.532}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.375}\DIFaddend ). Due to the
relatively small number of samples in each treatment group, it was
difficult to make a definitive statement regarding the specific type of
treatment on the amount of change in the structure of the microbiota.

\newpage

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Our study focused on comparing the microbiota of patients diagnosed with
adenoma, advanced adenoma, and carcinoma before and after treatment. For
all three groups of patients, we observed changes in their microbiota.
Some of these changes, specifically for adenoma, may be due to normal
temporal variation, however, those with advanced adenoma and carcinoma
clearly had large microbiota changes. After treatment, the microbiota of
patients with carcinoma changed significantly more than the other
groups. This change resulted in communities that more closely resembled
those of patients with a normal colon. This may suggest that treatment
for carcinoma is not only successful for removing the carcinoma but also
at reducing the associated bacterial communities. Understanding the
effect of treatment on the microbiota of those diagnosed with carcinomas
may have important implications for reducing disease recurrence. It is
intriguing that it may be possible to use microbiome-based biomarkers to
not only predict the presence of lesions but to also assess the risk of
recurrence due to these changes in the microbiota.

Patients diagnosed with adenoma and advanced adenoma, however, did not
experience a shift towards a community structure that resembled those
with normal colons. This may be due to the fundamental differences
between the features of adenomas and advanced adenomas and carcinoma.
Specifically, carcinomas may create an inflammatory milieu that would
impact the structure of the community and removal of that stimulus would
alter said structure. It is possible that the difference between the
microbiota of patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma and those with
normal colons is subtle. This is supported by the reduced ability of our
models to correctly classify patients with adenomas and advanced
adenomas relative to those diagnosed with carcinomas {[}Figure S1{]}.
Given the irregular distribution of microbiota across patients in the
different diagnosis groups, it is possible that we lacked the
statistical power to adequately characterize the change in the
communities following treatment.

There was a subset of patients (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{7 }\DIFaddend of the 26 with carcinomas) who
demonstrated an elevated probability of carcinoma after treatment. This
may reflect an elevated risk of recurrence. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{23.08}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{26.92}\DIFaddend \% prevalence of
increased carcinoma probability from our study is within the expected
rate of recurrence (20-30\% \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 3, 4\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend ). We hypothesized that these
individuals may have had more severe tumors; however, the tumor severity
of these \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6 individuals (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{7 individuals (1 with Stage I, }\DIFaddend 3 with Stage II\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and 3 with
Stage III) was similar to the distribution observed among the other \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{20 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{19
}\DIFaddend patients. We also hypothesized that we may have sampled these patients
later than the rest and their communities may have reverted to a
carcinoma-associated state; however, there was not a statistically
significant difference in the length of time between sample collection
among those whose probabilities increased (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{358 (336 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{331 (246 }\DIFaddend - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{458}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{358}\DIFaddend ) days) or
decreased (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{334 (256 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{364 (301 }\DIFaddend - \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{399}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{434}\DIFaddend ) days) (Wilcoxon Test; P-value = \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{0.56}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.39}\DIFaddend ) (all
days data displayed as median (IQR)). Finally, it is possible that these
patients may not have responded to treatment as well as the other \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{20 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{19
}\DIFaddend patients diagnosed with carcinoma and so the microbiota may not have
been impacted the same way. Again, further studies looking at the role
of the microbiota in recurrence are needed to understand the dynamics
following treatment.

Our final hypothesis was that the specific type of treatment altered the
structure of the microbiome. The treatment to remove adenomas and
advanced adenomas was either polyp removal or surgical resection whereas
it was surgical resection alone or in combination with chemotherapy or
with chemotherapy and radiation for individuals with carcinoma. Because
chemotherapy and radiation target rapidly growing cells, these
treatments would be more likely to cause a turnover of the colonic
epithelium driving a more significant change in the structure of the
microbiota. Although, we were able to test for an effect across these
specific types of treatment, the number of patients in each treatment
group was relatively small. Finally, those undergoing surgery would have
received antibiotics and this may be a potential confounder. However,
our pre-treatment stool samples were obtained before the surgery and the
post-treatment samples were obtained long after any effects due to
antibiotic administration on the microbiome would be expected to occur
(344 (266 - 408) days). We also found no difference in the community
structure of those that received surgery and those that did not as a
treatment for adenoma or advanced adenoma.

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This study expands upon existing research that has established a role
for the microbiota in tumorigenesis and that demonstrated the utility of
microbiome-based biomarkers to predict the presence of colonic lesions.
We were surprised by the lack of a consistent signal that was associated
with treatment of patients with adenomas or advanced adenomas. The lack
of a large effect size may be due to differences in the role of bacteria
in the formation of adenomas and carcinomas or it could be due to
differences in the behaviors and medications within these classes of
patients. One of the most exciting of these future directions is the
possibility that markers within the microbiota could be used to
potentially evaluate the effect of treatment and predict recurrence for
those diagnosed with carcinoma. If such an approach is effective, it
might be possible to target the microbiota as part of adjuvant therapy,
if the biomarkers identified play a key role in the disease process. Our
data provides additional evidence on the importance of the microbiota in
tumorigenesis by addressing the recovery of the microbiota after
treatment and opens interesting avenues of research into how these
changes may affect recurrence.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\textbf{\emph{Study Design and Patient Sampling.}} Sampling and design
have been previously reported in Baxter, et al \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 24\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . Briefly, samples
were stored on ice for at least 24h before freezing. Although we cannot
exclude that this sampling protocol may have impacted the gut microbiota
composition all samples were subjected to the same methodology. Study
exclusion involved those who had already undergone surgery, radiation,
or chemotherapy, had colorectal cancer before a baseline fecal sample
could be obtained, had IBD, a known hereditary non-polyposis colorectal
cancer, or familial adenomatous polyposis. Samples used to build the
models for prediction were collected either prior to a colonoscopy or
between one and two weeks after initial colonoscopy. The bacterial
community has been shown to normalize back to a pre-colonoscopy
community within this time period \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 27\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . Our study cohort consisted of 67
individuals with an initial sample as described and a follow up sample
obtained between 188 - 546 days after treatment of lesion {[}Table 1{]}.
Patients were diagnosed by colonoscopic examination and
histopathological review of any biopsies taken. Patients were classified
as having advanced adenoma if they had an adenoma greater than 1 cm,
more than three adenomas of any size, or an adenoma with villous
histology. This study was approved by the University of Michigan
Institutional Review Board. All study participants provided informed
consent and the study itself conformed to the guidelines set out by the
Helsinki Declaration.

\textbf{\emph{Treatment.}} For this study treatment refers specifically
to the removal of a lesion with or without chemotherapy and radiation.
The majority of patients undergoing treatment for adenoma or advanced
adenoma were not treated surgically {[}Table 1{]} but rather via
colonoscopy. All patients diagnosed with carcinomas were treated with at
least surgery or a combination of surgery and chemotherapy or surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation. The type of chemotherapy used for patients
with CRC included Oxaliplatin, Levicovorin, Folfox, Xeloda,
Capecitabine, Avastin, Fluorouracil, and Glucovorin. These were used
individually or in combination with others depending on the patient
{[}Table 1{]}. If an individual was treated with radiation they were
also always treated with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy generally used
18 mV photons for treatment.

\textbf{\emph{16S rRNA Gene Sequencing.}} Sequencing was completed as
described by Kozich, et al. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 28\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . DNA extraction used the 96-well Soil
DNA isolation kit (MO BIO Laboratories) and an epMotion 5075 automated
pipetting system (Eppendorf). The V4 variable region was amplified and
the resulting product was split between four sequencing runs with
normal, adenoma, and carcinoma evenly represented on each run. Each
group was randomly assigned to avoid biases based on sample collection
location. The pre and post-treatment samples were sequenced on the same
run.

\textbf{\emph{Sequence Processing.}} The mothur software package
(v1.37.5) was used to process the 16S rRNA gene sequences and has been
previously described \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 28\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . The general workflow using mothur included
merging paired-end reads into contigs, filtering for low quality
contigs, aligning to the SILVA database \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 29\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend , screening for chimeras
using UCHIME \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 30\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend , classifying with a naive Bayesian classifier using
the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP)\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 31\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend , and clustered into Operational
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using a 97\% similarity cutoff with an average
neighbor clustering algorithm \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 32\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)}\DIFaddend . The number of sequences for each
sample was rarefied to 10523 to minimize the impacts of uneven sampling.

\textbf{\emph{Model Building.}} The Random Forest \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 33\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) }\DIFaddend algorithm was
used to create the three models used to classify pre and post-treatment
samples by diagnosis (adenoma, advanced adenoma, or carcinoma). The
total number of individuals in the pre versus post-treatment models was
67 individuals. There were a total of 22 individuals in the pre versus
post-treatment adenoma model, 19 individuals in the pre versus
post-treatment advanced adenoma model, and 26 individuals in the pre
versus post-treatment carcinoma model {[}Table 1{]}.

Similarly, the Random Forest \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 33\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) }\DIFaddend algorithm was also used to create the
three models used to classify normal versus diagnosis. These samples
were obtained using the same methodology as described earlier in this
section. All samples used for this component of model training were from
pre-treatment samples only. The total number of individuals in the
normal versus diagnosis models was 423 individuals {[}Table 2{]}. There
were a total of 239 individuals in the normal versus adenoma model, 262
individuals in the normal versus advanced adenoma model, and 266
individuals in the normal versus carcinoma model {[}Table 2{]}.

All models included only OTU data obtained from 16S rRNA sequencing and
were processed and cleaned using the R package caret (v6.0.76).
Optimization of the mtry hyper-parameter involved making 100 different
80/20 (train/test) splits of the data where the same proportion was
present within both the whole data set and the 80/20 split. For each of
the different splits, 20 repeated 10-fold cross validation was performed
on the 80\% component to optimize the mtry hyper-parameter by maximizing
the AUC (Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operator Characteristic).
The resulting model was then tested on the hold out data obtained from
the 20\% component. For \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{all }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{adenoma }\DIFaddend pre versus post-treatment models the
optimized \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mtry was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mtrys were }\DIFaddend 2 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and for all }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(n = 42), 42 (n = 26), and 914 (n = 32) for
adenoma. For advanced adenoma the mtrys were 2 (n = 26), 52 (n = 14),
and 1353 (n = 60). For carcinoma the mtrys were 2 (n = 36), 41 (n = 54),
and 863 (n = 10). For the }\DIFaddend normal versus diagnosis models the optimized
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mtry was 2. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mtrys were (n = NA), (n = NA), and (n = NA) for adenoma. For advanced
adenoma (n = NA), (n = NA), and (n = NA). For carcinoma (n = NA), (n =
NA), and (n = NA). }\DIFaddend The hyper-parameter, mtry, defines the number of
variables to investigate at each split before a new division of the data
was created with the Random Forest model \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdel{33}%DIFDELCMD < {]}%%%
\DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(33).
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For each of the pre versus post-treatment models assessment of the most

process mentioned in the previous paragraph and were what was used for the final pre versus post-treatment models. For the

These corresponding reduced OTU normal versus diagnosis models were then
put through the same process mentioned in the previous paragraph and
were what was used for the final normal versus diagnosis models. For the pre versus post-treatment models the final optimized mtry was 2 and for the normal versus diagnosis models the final optimized mtry was 2.

}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Each }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{For the diagnosis models that were trained on a completely independent
sample set, each }\DIFaddend model was then applied to our 67-person cohort {[}Table
1{]} based on diagnosis: adenoma (pre-treatment adenoma (adenoma n = 22
and disease free n = 0) versus post-treatment adenoma (adenoma n = 0 and
disease free n = 22)), advanced adenoma pre-treatment advanced adenoma
(advanced adenoma n = 19 and disease free n = 0 ) versus post-treatment
advanced adenoma (advanced adenoma n = 0 and disease free n = 19), and
carcinoma (pre-treatment carcinoma (carcinoma n = 26 and disease free n
= 0) versus post-treatment carcinoma (carcinoma n = 1 and disease free n
= 25)). The application of the pre versus post-treatment models
generated the probabilities that the sample was a pre-treatment sample.
The application of the normal versus diagnosis models generated the
probabilities that the sample was that specific diagnosis (adenoma,
advanced adenoma, or carcinoma). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We also looked at similarities between
the models by looking for overlap in the top 10}\% \DIFadd{of important OTUs to
each respective model.
}\DIFaddend 

\textbf{\emph{Statistical Analysis.}} The R software package (v3.4.1)
was used for all statistical analysis. Comparisons between bacterial
community structure utilized PERMANOVA \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 34\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) }\DIFaddend in the vegan package
(v2.4.3). Comparisons between probabilities as well as overall
differences in the median relative abundance of each OTU between pre and
post-treatment samples utilized a paired Wilcoxon ranked sum test.
Comparisons between different treatment for lesions utilized a Kruskal
Wallis test. Where multiple comparison testing was appropriate, a
Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction was applied \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {[}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend 35\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < {]} %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) }\DIFaddend and a corrected
P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The P-values
reported are those that were BH corrected. Model rank importance was
determined by obtaining the median MDA from the 100, 20 repeated 10-fold
cross validation and then ranking from largest to smallest MDA.
