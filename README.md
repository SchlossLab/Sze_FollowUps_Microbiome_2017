## Differences in the Stool Microbiome Before and After Colorectal Cancer Treatment

**Background:** Colorectal cancer (CRC) continues to be a worldwide health problem with early detection being used as a key component in mitigating deaths due to the disease.  Previous research suggests a link between fecal bacterial microbiome and CRC. The overall objective of our study was to investigate the changes in the bacterial microbiome after surgery in patients with lesion (i.e. adenoma or carcinoma). Specifically, we wanted to identify what within the community was different within those undergoing surgical removal
of lesion. We also wanted to investigate the use of the bacterial microbiome and Fecal Immunoglobulin Test (FIT) to build models which could classify individuals as having a lesion or as before surgery.   
**Results:** Adenoma individualâ€™s bacterial microbiome were more similar to their pre-surgery  sample then those with carcinoma (P-value = 0.00198). Their change in FIT was also significantly different then those with carcinoma (P-value = 2.15e-05). There was no significant difference in any indivdiual OTU between samples before and after surgery (P-value > 0.125). A model with a total of 37 variables was able to classify lesion (AUC = 0.847 - 0.791) while the model to classify samples as before surgery had 33 variables
(AUC = 0.79 - 0.651). The after surgery samples had a significant decrease in the model positive probability of a lesion or before surgery sample (P-value = 1.91e-11 and 6.72e-12).  In total there were 14 OTUs that were common to both models and the majority of these
classified to commensal bacteria (Bacteroides, Blautia, Streptococcus, and Clostridiales).   
**Conclusions:** Our data suggests that treatment not only significantly reduces the probability of having a colonic lesion within our models but also causes detectable changes in the bacterial microbiome. Further surveillance of these individuals will enable us
to determine whether models such as the ones we present could be used to predict recurrence of colorectal cancer.
